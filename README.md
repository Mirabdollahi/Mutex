# Mutex

Being single-threaded doesn't necessarily mean we wouldn't eventually end up in some kind of race condition. JavaScript is single-thread but there is no race condition only for language implementors their self. They devide execution time for different sections of code and end user practically experience some kind of multi-threaded behavior.
We some how have to address this kind of uncertainty that we couldn't be sure in every situation which part of our code is going to run next. Mutex aims to provide this necessity for JavaScript developers, especially for those who codes in node.js which is really needed in many situations.
